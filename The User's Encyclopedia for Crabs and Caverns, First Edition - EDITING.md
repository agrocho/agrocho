## What is Crabs and Caverns?
Crabs and Caverns is an entirely free, ***[Markdown-Formatted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)*** tabletop [^GameSystem] roleplaying game made in ***[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)***. Beginning in 2024, C&C was designed and built by a community of people who wanted the best tabletop game experience possible, for both the physical and digital world.

A major issue that plagues online tabletop games are the perils of PDF's; using game systems designed for the pen-and-paper age on a computer requires the players to jump and dive between a number of semi-related PDFs that may or may not have the information they are searching for. In fact, this was the main motivator for C&C.

This document is best experienced in Obsidian, although it likely can be used in other Markdown editors.[^markdown] Alternatively, I regret to inform you that this document can be exported and shared as a PDF.

This User's Encyclopedia serves as one monolithic resource for Crabs and Caverns, First Edition. We wanted to set out to prove that the 'puter was mightier than the pen. No more saying, "Oh, I don't think it's in this book," or, "That book looks cool, but it's on backorder." 

Instead, C&C aims to be as close to a one-and-done file as possible. As the game matures, new editions of the system will have new editions of the User's Encyclopedia and Game Master's Encyclopedia released. This allows for major edition releases that incorporate community feedback.

A quick point, regarding the name; Crabs and Caverns was a temporary title to help denote that this was a game of "things" and "places," and how they interact. As we all know, temporary fixes tend to last the longest. 

---

## How is Crabs and Caverns Constructed?
Crabs and Caverns can be divided into two separate sections:

### Official Material:
 - This includes the User's Encyclopedia, the Game Masters' Encyclopedia, and First-Party Modules released directly from the Crabs and Caverns team.
 
### Community Material:
- This includes Third-Party Modules, like community-made story modules, equipment expansions, and other reference modules.

<br>

Official Material is made of a baseline of material originating from the Crabs and Caverns team. That being said, Community Material that has overwhelming support by the community can and will be adopted into Official Material.

For example, a homebrew rule for grappling that a majority of players like more than the Official interpretation can and will be adopted into the Official Material if the community believes that it should be adopted. 

In addition to adding items, the community can vote to remove aspects of the system. If players don't like a rule, or if a weapon simply doesn't make sense, then there's no reason to keep it. Crabs and Caverns is an ever-changing, community driven project.

---

## On Integrity, Ethics, and Morals

This section serves to lay a foundation for the Crabs and Caverns game system's governing policies. We also require that Community Material creators follow the same behavior. Those who do not conform to these really, *really* easy requirements will be removed from the community. 

### Crabs and Caverns will ALWAYS:

1. Be easy to use, easy to teach, easy to learn, and easy to build.
2. Listen and implement community feedback, and maintain our core integrity.
3. Help creators make and adapt fun and engaging stories for all to play.
4. Use the metric system in both Official and Community Material.
5. Support the community of creators who want to bring their stories to life. 

### Crabs and Caverns will NEVER:

6. Require payment for the game system, Official Material or Community Material.
7. Work for every setting and story.
8. Allow content creators to hold game content ransom in exchange for payment. 
9. Attempt to steer the project down a path the community doesn't want to follow. 
10. Be perfect. Everything is a compromise; if you have a good homebrew rule, write it down and publish it as Community Material!

Highlighting Point 8:
>Crabs and Caverns module creators are *forbidden* from charging money in exchange for game content. If you make content, you make content for everyone.

That being said, people are free to donate to module creators; if you feel like someone has made something worth paying for, you can donate as much as you please.

 If we make a bad decision regarding the soul of the project, call us out. You, the reader, are a part of the checks and balances that keeps Crabs and Caverns in line. Don't you ever forget that.

Crabs and Caverns is designed for, shaped by, and possible because of people like ***you***.

## Navigating This Document

>You can navigate this file through a multitude of ways. Through the power of Obsidian, you can use ```ctrl+f``` to navigate this file. Simply hit ```ctrl+f```, search for the topic you want, and click the up or down arrow at the top to get where you want.
>
>Another method of navigating this document is by using Obsidian's built-in Outline function, which can be opened by clicking on the rectangular "expand" icon in the top-right, followed by the three horizontal lines. I cannot stress this fact enough; this document was designed to be used in Obsidian's read-only mode. Access read-only mode by clicking the pencil or book icon in the top right of the page you're using; when you're in read-only mode, there will be a pencil icon in the top right.
>
>Alternatively, you may see [hyperlinks](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperlink) that can take you to certain parts within (or out outside of) this document. These are useful for everyone, regardless of search method; the first mention of a section with a heading, like the [[#resources]] section, will be a clickable term. For example, go ahead and hit ```crtl+f``` and search the word [[#weapons| weapon]]. 
>
>If we've done our due diligence, the *first* instance of any word with a relevant section will have a hyperlink. That way, when you search for any term that's unclear, you'll be able to quickly navigate to the table, chart, or paragraph describing the item, concept, or topic you wish to learn more about.
>
>Regrettably, because this will be a large document, it may seem bulky to navigate. Distributed documents, like having a separate file for items or weapons or [[#Armor|armor]] or [[#species]] while having its advantages, ultimately have the issue where the item, armor, weapon, or species is in the file you're not looking for. 
>
>By using the first word as the linked term, searching should be easy. One of the directives of C&C is that the resources to answer any question should be able to be found within ten seconds. Any more than that, and people tend to get off topic.
>
>In the next section, we'll discuss ***Characters***, their ***[[#Traits]]*** and ***[[#Skills]]*** and how characters ***interact*** with the world.

# 2. Character Creation
>[!faq] This section covers all aspects of building a character.

>Character Creation in other systems can be complicated, having players bounce back and forth between different pages and PDFs. In Crabs and Caverns, character creation is broken down into simple steps.

## What is a Character? 

>A character is how a player[^player] interacts with the world, and they can take many forms. 
>
>Characters, like real-life people, are dynamic and multi-faceted; people rarely do drastic things for no reason. Likewise, relatively few people are willing to die for their cause.
>
>Those that are willing to, however, are committed and driven people. This includes your character.

### Things Characters Are

>***[[#Traits]]*** are the major statistics of C&C, and define how your character is described. The higher a character's ***[[#Might]]***, the more likely they'll be described as "strong" or "muscular". The higher a character's ***[[#Coordination]]***, the more likely they'll be described as "swift" or "agile". Likewise, if a character's ***[[#Brilliance]]*** is low, they may just be described as "stupid" or "simple." 
>
>Traits are only modified during character creation and major events, like losing a limb or being blessed by a God or Goddess. Your Traits also denote the starting value of your Skills. Refer to the ***[[#Traits-Skills Matrix]]*** for a more coherent explanation.
>
>***[[#Skills]]*** are the minor statistics of C&C, and are how characters accomplish tasks. Their starting value is derived from the trait that the skill draws from. The higher a skill's value is, the more likely your character will be able to accomplish that task. If a character has a 66 in the skill *Quick Attack*, they will likely hit 2 out of 3 times. 
>
>Skills are modified by the player, and go up to 99. That leaves a 1% chance of a skilled character failing a given test. Nobody's perfect, even you.
>
>***[[#Tags]]*** are Crabs and Caverns' way of giving characters proficiency with skills, weapons, abilities, and knowledge. They're a vital part of the C&C system, as they allow for characters to "feel" different, mechanically speaking. This way, you don't always make the same wizard that plays the same way as the last hundred did. 
>
>By spending experience on a Tag, a character could get something such as proficiency with a weapon or skill, or become more knowledgeable about certain topics.

### Things Characters Have

>Characters have common ***[[#equipment]]***, but flavoring your character and their actions is very important. This allows players and game masters to reference relatively simple equipment tables, while still letting players craft the character they want. 
>
>The following example serves to explain:
>
>>[!abstract] A Tale of Two Swords
>>
>>While *Pirate Captain Parker* and *Condor the Indefatigable* both have short swords, the Pirate is equipped with an ornate, stylish, and recently oiled cutlass purchased mere minutes ago; likewise, Condor's short sword was taken from the torso of a slain enemy countless decades ago, chipped blade and wobbly handle both looking and feeling their age. However, both weapons are mechanically identical unless otherwise noted. They use the statistics of the short sword weapon, listed down in the ***[[#Weapons|weapon table]]***. 
>
>Describing your character, their equipment, and how they interact is half the fun! Crabs and Caverns seeks to avoid the pitfalls of other game systems where a stick-figure character swings a sword twice, misses both times, and then waits twenty minutes until it's their turn to miss again. 
>
>Perhaps your character, who has a very high Coordination trait, gracefully ducks and rolls to avoid damage; if another character has low Coordination, they may instead stumble and drop items carelessly. 
>
>Work with your Game Master and other party members to describe combat, investigation, and other interactions within the world. 

### Things Characters Do
>***[[#Tests| Characters interact with the world by passing or failing Tests]]***. The outcomes of tests vary in severity; failing to persuade the grumpy, hungover bartender for free drinks at the bar may have you thrown out, or *worse.* 
>
>One important difference between Crabs and Caverns and some other game systems is that, just like in real life, characters are free to attempt *any* test, whether or not a character is capable of that skill. 
>
>Whether they pass or fail the test is up to their skills (and, of course, the dice gods), but there should only rarely if ever be a situation where the party is locked out of most options.
>
>Additionally, some tests are flexible; in many cases, most people are willing to bend the rules. Just because your character failed a test doesn't mean that your character has lost everything, just that particular avenue.
>
>>[!abstract] Maybe I *don't* know you...
>>*Pirate Captain Parker* has just arrived at Cobalt Atoll, and the first thing he sees is a wanted poster emblazoned with his caricature. The second thing he sees is the dockmaster, who is rather quickly approaching him and his vessel. Having previously failed a Disguise test to conceal his face, he quickly thinks of another option; perhaps the dockmaster would be willing to ignore Pirate Captain Parker and his vessel if he was paid handsomely...
>
>Passing and failing tests is also how combat is conducted. To attack, you must pass a Quick Attack, Power Attack, Focus, or Knowledge skill test, depending on the attack.
>
>After the test is passed, damage dealt must be at least as much as the soak value of the enemy. After the damage exceeds the enemy's soak value, the remaining damage is turned into exhaustion. This is a very, very brief overview; for more information, refer to the ***[[#combat|combat subsection]]*** in the ***[[#resources|resources section]]***. 

### Tips for Character Building --REDO
>Building characters from the ground up can be difficult, but 

---

## Step Zero
>>[!check] Determine Your Character's Concept
>
>The first step[^StepZero] to making a character is knowing what you want to play. Perhaps you've always wanted to pretend to be a knight in service of the forces of good; maybe you're a farmer-turned-freedom-fighter seeking to stop the oppression from authority. 
>
>Get a vague idea of who you want to play, flesh out the concept to a refined final image, and then follow the next steps to bring your character to life.
>>[!tip] Ahoy!
>>In the case of Pirate Captain Parker, he is a defector from the Royal Navy of Keflos. He was not particularly loyal to King Stuna the Unfortunate, whom Parker believes was a weak leader; instead, Pirate Captain Parker and his band of merry crewmen decided to abandon the military life and seek out treasure. 
>>
>>Unfortunately for Captain Parker, his old ship was discovered by Royal Navy forces off the southern coast of Troydal and was sank with almost all hands. Now, with a grudge against anyone loyal to the King of Keflos, Pirate Captain Parker seeks to employ his skills elsewhere. 
>
>Now that you have an idea of what your character is, you can now build the character's mechanics to reflect that concept. 
>
>Ask the Game Master and the other players in your party if you're struggling for ideas; this game is a game of cooperation, and that starts at character creation.
>
>---

## Step One
>>[!check] Allocate Trait Points From the Standard Array
>
>***[[#Traits|Traits]]***, the seven defining characteristics of your character, are chosen from a standard array of predetermined numbers. 
>
>A standard array was chosen to avoid the misfortune that the dice gods can sometimes inflict, while also avoiding the "balancing" some game masters insist on. 
>
>---
### Traits Standard Array
>The standard array is as follows:
>
|60|50|40|40|30|20|10|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
>
>---
>To build a character, determine which of the above numbers you want to apply to which trait. When you apply a number to a trait, that trait's derived skills gain that base number. 
>
>***Pirate Captain Parker's Assigned Traits:***
>
>Pirate Captain Parker's breakdown will look like this:
>
>[[#Might]]|[[#Coordination]]|[[#Senses]]|[[#Brilliance]]|[[#Reverence]]|[[#Guile]]|[[#Endurance]]
>-|-|-|-|-|-|-
>60|70|50|20|30|40|50
>
>>[!abstract] Arr!
>>Pirate Captain Parker is a strong and stupid pirate. He can dodge and swing from ropes like a scallywag, yet still take a punch and keep his liquor down.
>>
>>That being said, he's not very capable of resisting magical attacks or piecing together clues. 
>>
>>Now that we have the basic traits of Pirate Captain Parker established, we can add his starting experience to his derived skills.
>
>When you gain experience, you can spend them to increase skills; traits only change if something drastic happens. 
>
>>[!danger] Do note: Traits and Skills can only go up to a 99/100. There is *always* a chance that someone will fail, no matter how skilled or powerful they may be. 
>
>If Pirate Captain Parker is blessed by the Goddess of the Seas, his Senses trait (and its derived skills) may increase. Likewise, if his leg is removed by an attacker, the Game Master may rule that his Coordination is decreased. 
>
>>[!warning] *Your character should feel the effects of battle, but it shouldn't be overwhelming and annoying. Work with the Game Master to reach an outcome that feels reasonable.*
>
>After your character's traits have been settled on, you'll add your starting experience points to your individual skills.
>
>---

## Step Two
>>[!check] Apply Starting Experience to Skills
>
>Experience points are gained by completing quests, remediating side objectives, and finishing chapters. Experience is always awarded at the end of a chapter; side objectives and quests are "pooled" until the chapter is complete. 
>
>By base game rules, C&C doesn't apply bonus experience for participating in a session; Game Masters can apply it, but I feel that it discriminates against people who have real-life stuff come up.
>
>Players start with 100 starting experience, and they are free to spend it as they wish.
>
>Skills, like Traits, are measured from 1 to 100. If players roll a 1 to pass a test, they have a critical success. Likewise, a 100 is a critical failure. The higher a number you have in a skill, the higher your chance of success is. 
>
>For character creation, your starting skills will mirror the trait they are derived from; if you have a 60 in [[#Might]], then the derived skills [[#Athleticism]], [[#Power Attack]], and [[#Intimidation]] start with 60. 
>
>>[!abstract] Yaahargh!
>>Pirate Captain Parker attempts to bribe the dockmaster. To do so, he'll make a Diplomacy roll, which gets its starting number from its base trait, Guile. During this step of character creation, Parker's player added 8 skill points to his Diplomacy skill, leaving him with 4 starting experience left.
>>
>>Unfortunately for Parker, his Diplomacy roll was at disadvantage, because the dockmaster looked at the wanted poster which had a very handsome reward for turning in the pirate.
>>
>>After a roll of the dice, Parker's player rolled a 21 and a 49. Since it was at disadvantage, the lower (and better) number is discarded. Since that 49 is higher than Parker's Diplomacy skill (48), Parker fails to bribe the dockmaster, who yells for the guards.
>
>Below is a table showing how many experience points are needed to raise skill points by one.
>
### Skill Cost Array
>Skill Point Value | 1-10 | 11-20 | 21-30 | 31-40 | 41-50 | 51-60 | 61-70 | 71-80 | 81-90 | 91-99 |
>| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
>Experience Cost per Skill Point | 1 XP per Skill Point | 2 XP per Skill Point | 4 XP per Skill Point | 8 XP per Skill Point | 16 XP per Skill Point | 32 XP per Skill Point | 64 XP per Skill Point | 128 XP per Skill Point | 256 XP per Skill Point | 512 XP per Skill Point | 
>
>Refer to the [[#Traits-Skills Matrix]] to map out your starting skill points, then add your starting experience to skills of your choice.
>
>---

## Step Three
>>[!Check] Select Three Starting Tags
>---
>***[[#Tags]]*** are how Crabs and Caverns can have a classless character system while still making characters *feel* different. 
>
>Your character, who we'll pretend is a city guard who strictly enforces the law, should feel tangibly different than another character who is a farmer-turned-adventurer. Your character shouldn't just feel like another guy with a spear.
>
>By using Tags, you can give your character proficiency with different abilities, weapons, tools, and knowledge. For example, an all-knowing wizard would take many Knowledge Tags. A person who specializes in daggers would take the Dagger Tag.
>
>Characters are given 3 Tags to start with. If you want to take another Tag later on, you'll have to spend Experience to gain it. The costs are located in the table of the relevant tag.
>
>Some tags have prerequisites; be sure to check the requirements of a tag, and ensure that you meet the requirements before you take a tag and apply its benefits.

# 3. How do I Play?
>[!faq] This section discusses dice rolls, gameplay, interactions, and other mechanics.
---

>The first step is the hardest, and one this guide can't help you with: make friends.
>
>After that monumental task, you'll want to gather at least four of them. Crabs and Caverns works well with a group of 5-7 people, with one of them being the Game Master, or GM. Too few, and it doesn't really *work*. Too many, and people end up talking over each other.
>
>Other game systems try to differentiate their games with specialty dice and complex rolls. Crabs and Caverns tries to break the mold by relying on *one* single type of die; the ten-sided die[^d10].
>
>Any time you make a roll, you will roll the d10. Any time you attack, you will roll the d10. There's no custom-made dice sets that we have a royalty for, and we don't waste your time by making you decipher strange symbols that you need to flip back to a reference section for. Just roll a handful of d10, depending on the roll.
>
>To pass a test, you will be asked to roll a pair of d10s. The first d10 you roll will be the "tens" place, and the second d10 will be the "ones" place. If I roll a 7 followed by a 3, my roll was a 73. If I roll a 0 and a 4, my roll was a 4. If I roll a 5 and a 0, my roll was a 50.
>
>As a quick side note, it's important to declare which die is the "tens" die and which is the "ones" die *before* the roll. If you have multiple color dice, perhaps the green die is the "tens" die. If you use a digital dice roller (or only have one single d10), the first die is the "tens" and the second is the "ones". Work with your fellow players to come up with a system that works for you.
>
>If you roll a 0 on both dice, then you have actually rolled a 100! If you roll a 100, you have failed that test. As stated below, Skills and Traits can only go to a maximum of 99; everyone has a chance to fail, that's life.

### Armor
## Tests
>***Tests***, in their broadest form, are the challenges that characters face when attempting to do something. This involves [[#combat]], investigations, conversations, and any other situation when someone is trying to do something that isn't 
>

## Combat
>[!faq] This section describes everything related to Combat.
### Combat Breakdown
>***Combat*** in Crabs and Caverns occurs in ***Encounters***. 
>
>Encounters are made up of ***Rounds***, and every player (including the Game Master)[^enemy] gets a ***Turn*** in a round. 
>
>Encounters will last until one side is defeated, surrenders, or retreats.


### Actions
>Players have three ***actions*** per turn, and can spend them how they wish. Below is a table of actions that players can take.
>
>Action | Description
>-|-
>Move | Move up to your Movement Speed, which is determined by your species.
>Attack | Attack an enemy using a Power Attack or Quick Attack roll.
>Channel | Channel a spell through the Clutch using your Focus or Knowledge roll.
>Dodge | Dive, duck, or roll to avoid a single attack action using an Agility roll.
>Parry | Misdirect an enemy's attack using an Athleticism roll. 
>Block | Brace yourself from incoming damage using a Resilience roll.
>
>When attacking an enemy, a player will make a Power Attack or Quick Attack. If successful, the attack will hit, and damage will be dealt to the enemy.
>
>---
### Soak
>***Soak*** is a value that reduces incoming damage. If the total damage dealt is less than the ***Soak*** value of the target being hit, then no damage occurs. If more damage is dealt than the ***Soak*** value of the target being hit, then only the damage that goes over the ***Soak*** value harms the target.
>
>Target's Soak Value | Attacker's Damage Value | Damage to Target
>-|-|-|
>7|3|0
>7|7|0
>7|8|1

### Combat Example


[^GameSystem]: This game system is difficult to define; it is absolutely capable of being played in person with close friends and family, but it was designed around the habits of a group that primarily plays online.
[^StepZero]: I chose to denote this as Step Zero since it's kind of a "background task" that players can work on at any time. As in, you don't actively need to be building a character to be working on this step.
[^player]: That's you. You're the player. Why did you click on this?
[^story]: This was an early goal that simply wasn't feasible. Baseline Crabs and Caverns focuses on a high-fantasy setting, although writers aren't barred from trying to expand into other genres. 
[^enemy]: The Game Master controls all of the non-player characters, and the Game Master's turn is broken into sub-turns. This includes an "enemy npcs" turn, "friendly npcs" turn, and "non-aligned npcs" turn. Having the Game Master perform all of the non-player actions at the same time prevents rounds from slowing down. 
[^d10]: Cool people (that's you) call it a d10.
[^friends]: If you can't make friends, store-bought is fine.
[^markdown]: I don't know for sure; don't quote me on this.
